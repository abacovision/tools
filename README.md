#### First let'd upload the first script:
The getDns.py is a script that when you run it, you will get the IP addreses registred on Name Servers for this IP, this include all the services used for this IP (https, databases, etc).

You run the algorithm, and the script will return a list with a list including every registered IP on the DNS register, independet of which service are running on the server.
